Authors: x,x,x (up to 4 team members)


## Introduction
An application in C++ that uses OpenCV to solve Sudoku puzzles through Augmented Reality (AR). Our project for the TUM course Augmented Reality by Prof. X


## Usage
[Fill in with call funcs]


## Algorithm Breakdown
1. The algorithm must find a good frame from the 9x9 to take a frame from
1. Process the frame to extract the digits already in the sudoku
1. Solve the sudoku by calling a function to do it that returns all of the 2D sudoku solved
1. Compare the solved Sudoku with the unsolved one, and keep only the new values. This is done to ignore the already existing numbers
1. Project the solutions on the paper


## Known Challenges
- Reading a 9x9 grid with printed digits, and do number recognition on it
-


## Future
We would like the whole application to be inside a distributable app that we can place in the Apple App Store and Google Marketplace. Where using the phone's available cameras you could see Sudoku solutions in AR.
